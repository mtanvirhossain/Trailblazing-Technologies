# Trailblazing Technologies

A C# console application developed as my first university project. This application demonstrates fundamental object-oriented programming concepts and provides a client management system for subscription plan calculations.

## 📋 Overview

This project allows users to create and manage clients while calculating subscription plan costs based on predefined fees. It serves as a foundational learning project that showcases basic C# programming concepts and object-oriented design principles.

## 🚀 Features

- **Client Management**: Create and store new client information
- **Subscription Calculations**: Calculate subscription plan costs based on predefined fees
- **Data Listing**: Display all clients with their corresponding subscription data
- **Cost Analysis**: Highlight subscription costs for different client plans
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Demonstrates classes, objects, and inheritance concepts

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: C# (.NET Framework)
- **Type**: Console Application
- **Architecture**: Object-Oriented Programming
- **IDE**: Visual Studio

## 🎯 Key Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:
- **Classes and Objects**: Proper class structure and object instantiation
- **Switch Statements**: Control flow for user menu options
- **Data Structures**: Managing client data and subscription information
- **Method Implementation**: Creating reusable methods for calculations
- **User Input Handling**: Console-based user interaction
- **Data Display**: Formatting and presenting information to users

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio (or any C# IDE)
- .NET Framework

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mtanvirhossain/Trailblazing-Technologies.git
   ```
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio
3. Build and run the application

### Usage
1. Run the application
2. Follow the console menu options to:
   - Create new clients
